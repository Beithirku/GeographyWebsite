# GeographyWebsite

This is a website made for college in 2018, the aim was to have a website about 3 different countries, include a currency converter and a quiz about those countries too utilising JavaScript for most of this.

It also has a prompt for welcoming users via name, checks time of day to change the icon based on the current time of day, and shows the current time in the footer. 

The website is also responsive to screensize, has a colour hover on the flags which by default are monochromatic black and white, but when hovered on they turn to the flags colour.

Everything is structured in folders for specific assets mostly for neatness, rather than having an "asset" folder since it wasn't a huge project.
